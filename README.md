special station ability mod for starmade

this is a mod for starmade  
it requires the starloader mod by Jake0997 to function.

description:  
this mod adds powerful abilities to stations. these abilites include:   
-anchor stations: system wide jump inhibitors that pull every jumping ship to their location (working alpha  
-radar stations: system wide knowledge of approximate ship positions/movement  (planned)
-factory stations: passive mining/resource generation, possibly fueled by nearby stars (planned)
  
 core idea:  
 Make non-homebase stations viable and make empire building/ system control possible through powerful defense mechanics like jump control (anchor stations), better intel (radar stations) and resource rewards (passive mining)
